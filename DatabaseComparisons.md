### Notes:
- **MySQL**: Widely used in web applications due to its simplicity and performance. Good for small to medium-sized applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its advanced features and standards compliance. Suitable for applications requiring complex queries and high reliability.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Integrated well with other Microsoft products and is ideal for enterprises using Microsoft ecosystems.
- **Oracle Database**: Offers extensive features and scalability, making it suitable for very large applications with complex needs.
- **Node.js**: While not a database, Node.js is often used for server-side development and can be paired with any of the above databases. Itâ€™s known for its non-blocking architecture and ease of use in building scalable applications.

Each option has its strengths and ideal use cases, so the best choice depends on the specific needs and context of ones's web application.
